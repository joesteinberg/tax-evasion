<h2>1. Data</h2>
Most of our assigned parameter values and calibration targets are taken directly from the literature. There are a few, however, that we constructed ourselves from several data sources.

**Labor productivity process.** We model our idiosyncratic labor productivity process after GKKOC. Their process has two parts: a fixed effect that is constant over an individual's life and transmitted according to an AR(1) process in logs across generations; and a persistent shock that evolves according to an AR(1) process in logs over an individual's life but is not transmitted across generations. Our process is simpler: we have one component that follows one AR(1) process over an individual's life and follows a different AR(1) process across generations. To set the parameters of our process, we simulate data from \citet{gkkoc}'s process and estimate the parameters of our process on that data. Specifically, we first simulate the two GKKOC processes. We then estimate our own process on this simulated data.

**Entrepreneurial opportunity process.** We use the 2016 wave of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to calculate (i) the fraction of all working-age households with strictly positive business or farm income, and (ii) the fraction of households at age 25 with strictly positive business or farm income. We set the probability of having an entrepreneurial opportunity at birth, $p_0$, to (i). Given our assignment of the probability of losing an entrepreneurial opportunity, $p_1$, we then set the probability of regaining an entrepreneurial opportunity, $p_2$, so that the model is consistent with (ii).

**Labor income tax rates.** We use data from Table B-1 in \citet{cbo-57404} to compute the average labor income tax rates for different segments of the distribution, and then map these rates to our discretized labor productivity process, which has five states. The bottom 20\% of households, which corresponds to the first two labor productivity states in our model, pay no taxes. The middle 60\%, which corresponds to the second state in our model, have a 12.5\% average tax rate. The top 20\%, which corresponds to the fourth state in our model, pay 24.4\% in taxes on average. To compute the tax rate for the fifth state in our model, which contains the top 2.5\% of labor income earners, we take the weighted average of the tax rates for the top 1\% (30.2\%) and the 96th-99th percentiles (24.2\%).

**Corporate capital share.** We calculate the corporate income share by dividing profits of nonfinancial domestic corporations (line 13 in NIPA Table 6.16D) by nominal gross domestic product (line 1 of NIPA Table 1.1.5). We use the average corporate income share for 2010--2017 in our calibration to maintain consistency with the timing of the BLS labor share series.

**Detection rate.** To obtain an estimate for the rate at which offshore evasion is detected, we multiply the audit rate for individuals in the top 0.1\% of the income distribution by the probability that an auditor correctly detects an unfulfilled requirement to report offshore wealth. Based on figure A7 in \citet{glrrz}, we calculate that the average audit rate for individuals in the top 0.1\% from 2009-2019 was 8.1\%. Furthermore, figure 4(a) in their study shows that auditors correctly detected unfulfilled requirements to report offshore wealth for 10 individuals out of the 135 individuals audited, which comes to a 7.4\% detection rate for individuals audited. Multiplying the former by the latter, gives us approximately a 0.6\% detection rate. We thank Daniel Reck, one of the authors of the aforementioned study, for suggesting this approach.
